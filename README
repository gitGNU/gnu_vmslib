VMSLIB -- helps people port GNU software to VMS.

VMSLIB is a bunch of files and small routines that can help people to port
GNU programs to VMS.  It consists of a C function library, with routines
that are missing in the current system C libraries that have been seen so
far, maybe with the exception of GNU libc.  In VMSLIB, there are also a
bunch of scripts (in VMS terminology, they are called `command procedures')
which help a lot in writing makefiles, and other scripts.  There is more,
please read the README file in each directory for further instruction.

VMSLIB is different from the package you usually use by not really being a
program that you can use in itself.  Rather, you will tend to copy a few,
or maybe all of the files to whatever other GNU program you wish to port.
There is one program (really a script) that can be used directly, and that
is gen_descrip.com.  It is a command procedure that takes an input file
and generates a makefile, which you can use to automagically copy the right
files to the right other GNU packages.

Mail suggestions and bug reports for VMSLIB to levitte@e.kth.se.  If that
doesn't work, try bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu instead.  Please include
the VMSLIB version number, which you can get by looking in the file VERSION,
along with the version of VMS you are using.
