Format of startup data file (SYS$STARTUP:GNU_STARTUP.DAT):

We need to be able to define logicals, symbols, and to set up a help
library, as well as to install images.

The data file is divided into records, which start with the utility name
at the first column.  All subrecords start with one space.  This way, it
is as easy for a human as for a program to see when a record starts.

Subrecords start with a space, followed by a letter which defines what
has to be done:

	D\name\mode\values	To define a logical name.
	SL\name\value		To define a local symbol (used as a helper).
	SG\name\value		To define a global symbol.
	I\image\flags		To install an image.
	H\filespec		To install a help library.

An example would thus be (to take a complicated one) the Emacs record:

EMACS
 D\EMACS19_SOURCE\\-
	ELIZA$DKB0:[PUBLIC.GNU.EMACS_DEVELOPMENT.EMACS-19-LOCAL.]/TRANS=(CONCEAL),-
	ELIZA$DKB0:[PUBLIC.GNU.EMACS_DEVELOPMENT.EMACS-19-HACKING.]/TRANS=(CONCEAL),-

	ELIZA$DKB0:[PUBLIC.GNU.EMACS_DEVELOPMENT.EMACS-19.22.]/TRANS=(CONCEAL)
 D\PD\\ELIZA$DKB0:[PUBLIC.]
 D\ESHELL\\"*dcl*"
 H\PD:[GNU.HELP]GNU.HLB
 SL\BINDIR\PD:[GNU.VAX.BIN]
 SL\VMSLIBDIR\EMACS19_SOURCE:[000000.VMS]
 SG\RUNEMACS\$'BINDIR'EMACS -MAP 'BINDIR'EMACS.DUMP
 SG\EMACS\@'VMSLIBDIR'KEPTEDITOR EMACS
 I\'BINDIR'EMACS.EXE\/OPEN/SHARE/HEADER

Well, that's about it...
