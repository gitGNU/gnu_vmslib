Sat Jul 13 15:40:21 1996  Richard Levitte  <LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se>

	* copy.com: A few bugs corrected.  It will possibly work better
	in some situations.

Wed Jul 10 19:40:31 1996  Richard Levitte  <LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se>

	* pipe.c (popen): Make sure we get rid of some warnings with
	DEC C.

Wed Jul 10 18:52:25 1996  Richard Levitte  <LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se>

	* canonicaldir.com: Added code to add default node, device and
	directory to the given path, if the request COMPLETE is given
	in P3.

	* decomplnm.com: Make sure canonicaldir.com is called with the
	COMPLETE argument.

Sun Feb 25 23:36:48 1996  Richard Levitte  <LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se>

	* descrip.mms_in (distclean): Added deletion of routines.tpu$section.

	* hackdebug.c: had to bend over to get the declaration of
	read() through with no compiler warnings and no linking errors.
	This applies to DEC C 5.2 only (or at least so far).

Wed Nov 29 13:42:04 1995  Richard Levitte  <LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se>

	* hackdebug.c: Include the headers before defining certain
	stdio symbols.

Wed Jun 28 07:42:32 1995  Richard Levitte  <LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se>

	* hackdebug.c: is now possible to compile with DEC C without
	/PREFIX=ALL

Tue Jun 27 16:58:38 1995  Richard Levitte  <LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se>

	* hackargv.c: is now possible to compile with DEC C without
	/PREFIX=ALL

Wed May 17 14:47:36 1995  Roland B Roberts  (roberts@panix.com)

	* hackargv.c: Added I/O redirection support for concatenation and
	VMS file attributes (to match documented features!).

Mon Sep 19 13:44:48 1994  Roland B Roberts <roberts@vaxms2.dnet.ge.com>

	* pipe.c (popen): the call to sys$crembx was short one parameter.

Fri Sep 16 10:53:21 1994  Roland B Roberts <roberts@vaxms2.dnet.ge.com>

	* pipe.c: added module version information.
	(pwait, pclose): give sys$synch the event flag through evf
	instead of an explicit `1'.

Thu Sep 15 18:23:53 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* pipe.c (pwait): close the file even if the process is gone.

Thu Sep 15 18:13:54 1994  Roland B Roberts <roberts@vaxms2.dnet.ge.com>

	* pipe.c: added the variable evf to hold the event flag used.
	(pwait, pclose): will only do sys$synch if subprocess still
	exists.
	(pclose): corrected the assignment with `==' to `='.
	(pdone): is now of type void instead of static int.
	(popen): now calls sys$spawn with &evf as event flag specifier.

Tue Sep 13 08:15:59 1994  Roland B Roberts <roberts@vaxms2.dnet.ge.com>

	* types.h: New file, which contains some common VMS types.

	* pipe.c: Includes types.h instead of pipe.h.  Has also been
	changed a lot to removed the limit on the number of pipes.
	Changed the PIPE structure to ba a doubly linked list instead
	of an array as part of this change.  All subprocesses now
	use event flag 0 for completion, also as part of removing the
	limit on the number of pipes.
	(popen): Doesn't abort on error anymore.  Instead, it returns
	NULL, after setting errno and vaxc$errno to the proper error
	code.
	(pclose): Now returns the exit status of the subprocess iff the
	subprocess didn't exit with a successfull status code.  It
	returns 0 if the subprocess exited with a successfull status
	code.

Wed Aug  3 10:50:24 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* utime.c (utime): Changed all `#ifdef __ALPHA' to `#ifdef __DECC'.

Fri May 27 19:38:27 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* compvmslib.com_in: Also compiles routines.tpu$section.
